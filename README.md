Calculator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) – Python

Project Description-
This project implements a basic command-line calculator in Python. The calculator provides the four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program utilizes functions to encapsulate each operation, a while loop for continuous use, and includes basic error handling to prevent crashes from non-numeric input (ValueError) and division by zero. It prompts the user to select an operation and enter two numbers, displaying the result until the user chooses to exit.
